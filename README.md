# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

Different models were applied to atcvive the desired accuracy percentage; however the highest was 73%. Despite the adjustments, 
the model's accuracy improved slightly but remained below the target of 75%.

**First Try**
2 hidden layers 
1stt hidden layer units 80
2nd hidden layer units 30
accuracy 73.14%

**Second Try**
3 hidden layers 
1stt hidden layer units 80
2nd hidden layer units 30
3rd hidden layer units 30
accuracy 72.79%

**Third Try**
3 hidden layers 
1stt hidden layer units 110
2nd hidden layer units 45
3rd hidden layer units 76
accuracy 72.85%

**Forth Try**
Random Forest model
accuracy 72.1%
